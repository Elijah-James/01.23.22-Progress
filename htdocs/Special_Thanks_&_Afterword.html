        <section class="Afterword">
            First of all, I would like to thank you for viewing my website. :D 
            It’s nice to know that my hard work wasn’t all for nothing. <br> <br>
            It has truly been a fun time creating this so far. I would like to thank Ma’am 
            Aline Teresa L. Mendoza for helping me throughout the entire process. 
            She would always clarify things whenever I didn’t understand them or had 
            misconceptions along the process of creating my website. I would also like to thank 
            my friends and classmates for helping out in finding errors or things that I could 
            have still improved on. They’ve been a great help in spotting things that I didn’t 
            whenever I scanned through the pages after I’ve changed something. <br> <br>
            Anyways, thank you once again for taking the time to view my website and have a 
            great rest of your day!
